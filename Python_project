### Pandas
pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.

Basically we have two types of data structure
1.series - a one dimenisonal labeled array holding any data of any type.
such as integers,strings,python objects.
2.data frame : data frame is two dimensional array hold data like two dimension arrat or table with rows and coulumns
data struture also contains labeled axis rows and columns
size mutable,potentially heterogeneous tabular data.
Data is organized in rows and columns (like a spreadsheet or SQL table)

============================
parameters:

data :ndarry,structured or homegeonous,literable,dict,or data frame

>>Dataframe.head() and DataFrame.tail() to view top and bottoms rows.
>dataframe.index or DataFrame.Columns to view the index and columns
>>dtypes -- what are types of colulmns that hold on it-float,init
>>describe() ==quick summary of data 
>>df.T -- Transposing of data
>>DataFrame.sort_index() sort by axis
